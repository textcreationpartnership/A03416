            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Many things paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this conference which eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped my memorie before I could come to commit them to the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of my pen. That which I retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is here publiſhed for thy ſolace,

The method cannot bee ſo exact as I could haue wiſhed. Hee that tracts a Fugitiue, muſt take the

By-path as well as the Rode-way. Herein could I not be my owne Caruer, being ouer-ſwayed with the current of his Streame. For the conueiance of the Dialogue, ſome few formall paſſages happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are tranſpoſed, but without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration either of words or ſenſe, If hee complaine of too much tartneſſe, let him blame his owne thundring, which turned my ſweet Wine into ſowre Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

Whence followeth, ſeing the next world is the time of Iustice, that God doth not there remit ſinnes, without exacting and inflicting the due puniſhment vnto the Authours, which is the Purgatorie the Catholique Church doth, and hath euer taught.

                  <p>How abſurd the Inference is, it will eaſily appeare by the ſcope of the text, and the ſence of the words. Our Sauiour there ſpeaketh <hi>de reatu peccati,</hi> of the guilt <hi>of Sinne,</hi> ſaying, <hi>(non remittetur)</hi> and doth not ſpecifie any paine to bee ſuffered for ſuch ſinnes, whoſe fault is forgiuen in this preſent life. Had he ſaid, <hi>Hee</hi> that <hi>ſinneth</hi> againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be vnpuniſhed in this world, nor in the world to come, the Inference had not beene amiſſe: <hi>Ergo</hi> ſome ſinnes are puniſhed in the world to come, which are not puniſhed in this world. But when hee ſayth, it ſhall bee forgiuen ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this VVorld nor in the VVorld to come, it is a meere fallacie, to drawe the ſpeech from the guilt to the puniſhment, inferring that ſome ſinnes ſhall be puniſhed in the next world, whoſe offence is forgiuen in this. The remiſſion (from which that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatiue Sinner is debar'd) is an act of mercie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man is conſidered as a Patient, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſutable to that time, and act of Iuſtice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Doctor dreameth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neyther can a ſinne be ſaid properly to be remitted, the due puniſhment wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of th'offender hath condignely ſuſtained. Hee that payes the vtmoſt farthing, is verie little beholding for the forgiueneſſe of his debt. But if you will needs vncaſe this ſentence of the figure wherewith it is beautified, I demaund whether doth our Sauiour ſpeake of the guilt or of the puniſhment, or of both. If he ſay the guilt ſhall not be forgiuen in this world, nor in the world to come, then your deduction muſt be this, <hi>Ergo</hi> the guilt of ſome mortall ſinnes ſhall
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4325:61"/>
bee remitted in the next world, which is not remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this; and ſo your Purgatorie (preſuppoſing a former aſſoylement from the guilt) will haue no ſubſiſtence. If hee ſpeake of the puniſhment, you muſt infer, <hi>Ergo</hi> ſome ſinnes ſhall be puniſhed in the next world, which are not puniſhed in this: which as all men confeſſe, ſo doth it affoord no aduantage to your cauſe. If you ſay that he ſpeaks of both <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> then as well the <hi>Guilt</hi> as the <hi>Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment</hi> of ſome mortall ſinnes ſhalbe then remitted, which your <note n="d" place="margin">Pag. 79</note> 
                     <hi>Suarez</hi> doth diſclaime. So that you are verie nimble thus to fetch a croſſe caper making the Lord of truth to ſpeake of <hi>Guilt</hi> in the former, and of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> in the latter part, to ſerue your turne.</p>

A King out of his royall compaſſion, firſt granteth, then ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the pardon of a malefactor: yet doth the party remaine in durance, and vndeliuered, till the ſame be publiſhed to the Country, at the Aſſizes: when it is publiquely read, doth not the Iudge ſay to the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the barre, Loe heere the King giues thee thy pardon, though it were vnder ſeale ſome moneths before? Nay doe not they who are vnacquainted
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4325:73"/>
with the Kings former grant, when they ſee the bolt and fetters ſtricken off, vſe wordes to this purpoſe, This fellow hath his pardon, or elſe he had bin truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp amongſt his Mates at the laſt execution? So likewiſe an Apprentice, at the expiration of his years is free by couenant; yet is hee not ſo taken by the Company, neither may hee ſet vp Shoppe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, till he be entred into the Hall-booke, at which time he is ſaid to be made free. Will you ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that th'one had three pardons, or th'other two freedomes? As the pardon, ſo alſo the freedome is but one. One and the ſame act, keepes one and the ſame denomination: though it bee differenced by more or leſſe perſpicuity of circumſtances, as of time and place. I ſee no reaſon why that ſhould be vnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable to the conſummation of any thing, which is attributed to the Initiation thereof.</p>

                  <p>Truſt me truly, <hi>Nick</hi> ſpeakes to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, marry you muſt not vnderſtand him of ſuch tranſient acts, as are both begunne and finiſhed at once without any poſſibility of Iteration. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a man aged thirty yeeres cannot properly be ſaid to be then borne, becauſe there is no poſſibility of a ſecond naturall birth; neither may a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man formerlie initiated with the Sacrament of Baptiſme, bee afterward ſaid to bee at anie other time ſacramentally baptized, becauſe one and the ſame perſon is onelie once capable of that ſacred rite. Of theſe and the like wee ſpeake onelie in <hi>praeterito,</hi> that ſuch a one was borne and baptized. But in ſuch permanent acts as may be repealed, renewed, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4325:74"/>
in matter or manner, by a proceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe perfected, the caſe is otherwiſe: they retaine their prime denomination, till they attaine their full end and conſummation.

                  <p>I ſee <hi>Nick</hi> begins to looke towards the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; and it is high time for good husbands, to make more haſt home; <hi>Iabals</hi> blazing-ſtar hath now ſpent it ſelfe, in an infectious vapour. This dayes chat wil ſerue as a perfume. He did well to bury his name in the frontiſpice of his book, as preſaging that his <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph</hi> ſhould be interred in eternall diſgrace.</p>
